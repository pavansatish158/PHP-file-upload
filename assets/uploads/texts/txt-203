VC2017 (VC15) is backward compatible to VC2015 (VC14). That means, a VC14 module can be used inside a VC15 binary. Because this compatibility the version number of the Redistributable is 14.1x.xx and after you install the Redistributable VC2017, VC2015 is removed but you can still use VC14.

If you have a 64-bit Windows, you must install both 32 and 64bit versions, even if you do not use Wampserver 64 bit.

------ After Installation ------
--- PhpMyAdmin
When starting phpMyAdmin, you will be asked for a user name and password.
After installing Wampserver 3, the default username is "root" (without quotes) and there is no password, which means that you must leave the form Password box empty.
There will be a warning:
You are connected as 'root' with no password, which corresponds to the default MySQL privileged account. Your MySQL server is running with this default, is open to intrusion, and you really should fix this security hole by setting a password for user 'root'.
This is not a problem as long as access to Phpmyadmin remain locally.
However, some web applications or CMS asking that the MySQL user has a password. In which case, you will create a user with password via the PhpMyAdmin Accounts Users tab.
